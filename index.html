	<h1>Dogs Are Perfect</h1>
	<p>My dogs wake up happy to see me every morning, no matter the condition I wake up in. I can sleep in late, wake up feeling great, and my dogs are happy to be by my side. I can wake up with far too little sleep in a hurry to get out the door to work, my dogs know no differance! They are happy for the few moments I give them before rushing out the door. When I come back, from a long day away, they again, are happy! In this way, all dogs are perfect.

	<h1>Even When They are Naughty, They are Perfect</h1>
	<p> Sometimes my dogs make mistakes, they eat things that weren't meant for them or sometimes get upset tummies when I'm not near by to let them out.. Sometimes they know better but had no other option, sometimes they know better but get caught up in the moment! No matter the case, they always share their simpathy or prove their pure inocense when I look them in the eye. They forgive me for being upset and often aim not to do that again! They always say sorry and move forward. Never holding a grudge for you having of brought down their vibe after an awesome rush of a play time on the couch. Later they come back and love you all the same.
